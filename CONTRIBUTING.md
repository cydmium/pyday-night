# Contributing
I want to start by saying thank you for considering contributing the Pyday Night.

There are lots of ways to contribute if you are interested.
- Check existing issues and see if there is anything you would be comfortable tackling
- If you have something you want to work on, submit a new issue and we can go from there
- Adding documentation is always appreciated

## Style Guidelines
I want to keep this project as clean and understandable as possible.
As such, I am maintaining a CHANGELOG based on the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) website.
I would appreciate any changes be noted in the CHANGELOG with a short description followed by a name or username and a contact method.

To maintain coding style consistency, I will be using the black autoformatter, and I suggest you do as well.
I will also be using isort to keep consistency with import ordering, but that is not as critical to code readability.

## Commit Message Guidelines
I am attempting to maintain some semblance of order in the commit messages.
Currently, that involves formatting the messages according to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) guidelines.
This style is somewhat new to me, so there is quite a bit of flexibility here, but do try to make your messages understandable and informative.

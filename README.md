# Pyday Night
When's a better time to party than on Pyday Night?

## Project Goal
Pyday Night aims to provide methods for working with solar altitude angles, in particular for use in determining the location of the day-night terminator.
This module provides similar functionality to the pysolar.solar.get_altitude function, but in a much simpler package.

## Acknowledgements
The code in this module is heavily based upon MATLAB code provided by Dr. Morris Cohen of Georgia Institute of Technology.
